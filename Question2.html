         <p style="border: solid gray; width:70%;">Coffee is a brewed drink prepared from roasted coffeebeans, the seeds of
             berries from certain flowering plant in the Coffea genus. From the coffee fruit, the seeds are separated to produce 
             a stable, raw product:unroasted green coffee. The seeds are then roasted, a process which transforms them into a 
             consumable product:roasted coffee, which is ground into fine particles that are typically steeped in hot water before 
             being filtered out,producing a cup of coffee.Coffee is darkly colored, bitter, slightly acidic and has a stimulating 
             effect in humans, primarily dueto its caffeine content.[3] It is one of the most popular drinks in the world[4] and can 
             be prepared and presented in a variety of ways (e.g., espresso, French press, caff√® latte, or already-brewed canned coffee).
             It is usually served hot, although chilled or iced coffee is common. Sugar, sugar substitutes, milk or cream are often
             used to lessen the bitter taste or enhance the flavor. It may be served with coffee cake or another sweet dessert, like 
             doughnuts. A commercial establishment that sells prepared coffee beverages is known as a coffeehouse or coffee</p></center>
